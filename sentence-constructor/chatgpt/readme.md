## Which Model

I'm using a free version of chatGPT. The model is running GPT-4 and one thing I found interesting is that when I asked it its parameters it would not disclose that. I worded that question 3 different ways using different terms that also mean parameters in this sense. It finally answered saying it didn't know the exact parameters but it was higher than GPT v3.5 which had 175B parameters.
