Here are some simple sentence structures with examples:

1. Subject + Verb (S + V)
Example: Birds fly.
2. Subject + Verb + Object (S + V + O)
Example: She eats an apple.
3. Subject + Verb + Adjective (S + V + Adj)
Example: The car is red.
4. Subject + Verb + Adverb (S + V + Adv)
Example: He speaks slowly.
5. Subject + Verb + Prepositional Phrase (S + V + PP)
Example: The book is on the table.

### Clues and considerations
