- clues and considerations

### Vocabulary Table
- The table should only include nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives
- Do not provide particles in the vocabulary tables, student needs to figure out what correct particles to use

### Sentence Structure

- Do not provide tenses or conjugation in the sentence structure
- Remember to consider beginner level sentence structures

Here are some simple sentence structures with examples:

1.  Birds fly. (Subject + Verb)
2.  She eats an apple. (Subject + Verb + Object)
3.  The car is red. (Subject + Verb + Adjective)
4.  He speaks slowly. (Subject + Verb + Adverb)
5.  The book is on the table. (Subject + Verb + Prepositional Phrase)

### Clues and considerations

- Talk about vocabulary but leave out Spanish words because student can reference the vocabulary table
